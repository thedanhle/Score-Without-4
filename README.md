## Inspiration 
Our team's inspiration came from our passion for games. We wanted to build our own game and learn how to program our own version of a user friendly video game.
## What it does
Our project is a rendition of the famous game, Connect 4. It involves 4 players and is played on a board four times the size of the original. To win, each player must attempt to connect 3 of their own pieces on the board to gain a point. The most points when the board is completely filled wins the game!
## How we built it
We built our game with the use of Python and Pygame. We used visual studio code and different uses of python libraries, such as numpy, math, and sys. For our user interface, we used Pygame to allow the user to interact with the board with a mouse and be able to keep track of their points. The python script allowed us to create a two-dimensional array in which it checked each individual game piece to determine whether or not it connected to 2 other pieces of their designated color, allowing the user to gain a point.
## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges that we ran into include searching through the rows and columns of the numpy array and setting comparison tests to see whether or not the values around a certain number were the same as the targeted number. We also had problems with the visuals of Pygame, including prompted text and input delay.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Accomplishments that we're proud of include a working implementation of our own game, created a project with a team that has little to no experience in Python before, and completing a project with basic knowledge from school and applied to a extracurricular.
## What we learned
We learned to use functions from Python libraries and Pygame, the syntax and semantics of a new programming language, and debugging approaches.
